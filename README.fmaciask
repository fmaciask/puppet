This puppet installation is only for my training. 
Currently has got only nginx module, took from puppetlabs

In the original nginx module there was an error caused for a miswritten lines.
This has been corrected and the module of nginx is working fine
Also, includes the configuration for blocking, using a file: block.cnf
