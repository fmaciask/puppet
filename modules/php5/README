PHP 5.5.4 

This is the module for Puppet that installs PHP 5.5.4.
I didn't consider any webserver as default, so it's a generic installation, so it should allow anyone to install Apache, Nginx or anyone.

License

PHP 5.5.4 license doesn't belong to me, and I don't change the source, only I make a module for it to be installed.
